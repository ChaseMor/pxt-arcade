## Step 1

Start by making 3 new ``||variables:variables||`` called ``||variables:laughingFace||``, ``||variables:happyFace||``, and ``||variables:neutralFace||``

Todo: Make GIF

## Step 2

From the ``||sprites:Sprites||`` section, drag a ``||variables:set mySprite to||`` block into the editor. Use the drop-down menu to change the name of the sprite from ``||variables:mySprite||`` to ``||variables:happyFace||``. 

## Step 3

Click on the gray square to open the Sprite Editor. Click on the dimensions at the bottom and change the dimensions of your sprite to `32x32`. Using the editor, draw a smiley face.

## Step 4

Drag another  ``||variables:set mySprite to||`` block into the editor and change the name of this sprite to ``||variables:laughingFace||``. Using the Sprite Editor again, change the image of this sprite to a laughing face.

## Step 5

Drag another  ``||variables:set mySprite to||`` block into the editor and change the name of this sprite to ``||variables:neutralFace||``. Using the Sprite Editor again, change the image of this sprite to a neutral face (i.e. one that is neither happy nor sad).

## Step 6

From the  ``||sprites:Sprites||`` section, drag a ``||sprites:set position to||`` block into the editor. Use the drop-down to change ``||variables:mySprite||`` to ``||variables:happyFace||``. Change its coordinates to **X = 80, Y = 8=30**

## Step 7

From the  ``||sprites:Sprites||`` section, drag a ``||sprites:set position to||`` block into the editor. Use the drop-down to change ``||variables:mySprite||`` to ``||variables:laughingFace||``. Change its coordinates to **X = 30, Y = 80**

## Step 8

From the  ``||sprites:Sprites||`` section, drag a ``||sprites:set position to||`` block into the editor. Use the drop-down to change ``||variables:mySprite||`` to ``||variables:neutralFace||``. Change its coordinates to **X = 130, Y = 80**
