# Activity: Getting Started with MakeCode Arcade

This activity starts with the basics to get started in MakeCode Arcade.

If you are new to MakeCode, welcome.  The MakeCode Arcade Platform is similar to other MakeCode Products such as Miro:bit, Minecraft and the [others](https://makecode.com).  Previous users of MakeCode products, or even other block based coding platforms, will see familiarities in how to work with Blocks and to run code on a in-browser simulator.  MakeCode Arcade uses block menus items for concepts such as Sprites, Scene, and Controller which form the basis for making MakeCode Arcade games along with blocks that are common to other MakeCode Products such as Loops, Logic, Variables and Math.

In this activity student will work with: 
* opening a game, game controls and playing a game
* creating a new game, Blocks vs Script
* "My Projects", game .png download, and creating a game link
* while true loop 


## Concept: Opening a game

# TODO: Video showing game being opened, explaining simulation

## Student Task 1: Playing [ TODO: insert some example game here, probably asteroid example ]
1. Click the "Asteroids" example game under the javascript category
2. Select "Open Example"
3. Press left and right on the direction pad to move the space ship, and press a to fire the laser. 
4. Look at what happens when the laser collides with an asteroid.

# TODO: Video showing creation of a new project


## Student Task 2: Starting your own game
1. Press the "Home" button in the upper left corner to return to the homepage
2. Press the "New Project" button 
3. The screen will have two blocks on it to start with - we will focus on the ``||loops:on start||`` block for now, so drag the ``||game:on game update||`` block to the side bar as shown below.

4. Drag out a new sprite and have it ``||sprite:say||`` something as shown below

5. At the bottom of the screen, select a name to save this game as, and click "Download" to download it.

6. You will turn in this file today, so be sure to keep track of it!


## Student Task 3: Importing your game
To make sure you saved your project properly, we should import it back into MakeCode Arcade!
1. Press the "Home" button in the upper left corner to return to the homepage.
2. The "My Projects" section should now include the game you created in the last task. To the right of it, there should be a button labeled "Import" - press that button.
3. Select "Import File..."
4. Select the file you saved in task 2.
5. Your code should now appear in the browser window.

Alternatively, you can simply drag the image that you downloaded onto the home page and it will load automatically.

## Student Task 4: Sharing your game
There is one other common way that we will keep track of our games: by making links to directly access the code.
1. Press the "Home" button in the upper left corner to return to the homepage.
2. Select your game from task 2 under "My Projects"
3. Select the share button in the upper left corner, as shown below. Verify that you want to publish the code, and keep track of the URL it shows - that is a link directly to your code!

## What did we learn?
1. What did the ``||sprite:say||`` block do when you added it to the game in task 2? 
2. Compare and contrast the two different ways that we saved our game; what are the benefits of each choice? Which do you think you would use if you wanted to email a game you made to your friend, and why would you make that decision?
3. Include the image created in task 2
4. Include the link created in task 4 here
