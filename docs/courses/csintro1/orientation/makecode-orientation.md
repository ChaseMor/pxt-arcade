# Activity: Getting Started with MakeCode Arcade

This activity starts with the basics to get started in MakeCode Arcade.

If you are new to MakeCode, welcome.  The MakeCode Arcade Platform is similar to other MakeCode Products such as Miro:bit, Minecraft and the [others](https://makecode.com).  Previous users of MakeCode products, or even other block based coding platforms, will see familiarities in how to work with Blocks and to run code on a in-browser simulator.  MakeCode Arcade uses block menus items for concepts such as Sprites, Scene, and Controller which form the basis for making MakeCode Arcade games along with blocks that are common to other MakeCode Products such as Loops, Logic, Variables and Math.

In this activity student will work with: 
* opening a game, game controls and playing a game
* creating a new game, Blocks vs Script
* "My Projects", game .png download, and creating a game link
* while true loop 


## Concept: [Concept 1 ]

# TODO: Create Video covering (list items above mostly).  Provide high level script outline.

Start with the following Turtle commands:  
* Forward *(steps)*  
* Turn *(degrees)*  
* Pen Down and Pen Up  
* Set pen color  
* Set Position *(x,y)*  

## Example: [Simple example 1]
1. Review the code below
2. Create the sample code and run the code
3. Save the code for the task (name it [simple name 1]) 
4. [specific comment - "look for..."]

```block  
// simple code here
```  

### ~hint
**Teacher Note**
TODO: These notes get removed for students and go to teacher guide so use exact format - think of advice on how the teacher might help un-stick students or reenforce concept.  A question you might pose.  "Ask students: What happens to the old value when we re-assign a new number to the lives? (Answer: it is destroyed and replaced with new assigned value)"  can use markdown lists here.
### ~

## Task: add [something] to the code 
1. starting with the [simple example 1] example 
2. add [something simple....]
3. add [something simple....]
4. Optional: Try adding [something that they have to infer or that might take a little longer than the simple items above]

```block
// :solution

/* example of a full solution that the teacher can use
comments are good!
we need the solution / end-solution tags so we can remove this for student version
*/ 
// :end-solution
```


## Concept: [concept 2 -another item form the list]

# TODO: might need a short video here 

[line or two of high level concept]

## Example: simple example 2 

1. Review the code below
2. Create the sample code and run the code
3. Save the code for the task (name it [simple name 1]) 
4. [specific comment - "look for..."]

```block  
// simple code here
```  

## Task: add [something] to the code 
1. starting with the [simple example 1] example 
2. add [something simple....]
3. add [something simple....]
4. Optional: Try adding [something that they have to infer or that might take a little longer than the simple items above]

### ~hint
 // Hint to student
### ~

```block
// :solution

/* example of a full solution that the teacher can use - good to follow on previous solution but not required
comments are good!
we need the solution / end-solution tags so we can remove this for student version
*/

// :end-solution


## What did we learn? [create 2 questions]

1. Describe how a [concept 1] makes programming easier, more powerful, reduced code, or something.... .  
2. Compare and contrast [something in the real world with coding] grocery store line or ask student to come up with a comparison.  
3. [Come up with a question of your choice]
