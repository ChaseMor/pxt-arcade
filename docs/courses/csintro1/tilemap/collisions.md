When Sprites interact with other objects, those events can have many kinds of responses. 

Collision events can change the score, number of lives, even change properties like the appearance of a sprite.

In this activity we will introduce collisions and use both collisions and on overlap events to update:
* on collision
* more onOverlap
* info section: score (life?)
* And add sprite images and update sprite images in our game
