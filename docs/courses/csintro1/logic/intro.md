# Logic Introduction -  if statement

Logic in Computer Science is about building code to enforce a set of rules that determines how our program will run.  In this section we will look at how performing a comparison can be used in code.  


In these activities students will work with:

* ``||logic:if||`` block

## Comparisons 

Comparison logic with the ``||logic:if||`` statement
 
In our games we will often want to compare values and take an action when the comparison statement is true.  

>Example:  Is myValue (3) smaller than a testValue (5)? If it is ``||logic:true||`` that myValue is smaller than the testValue then we will add 1 to myValue.

We perform comparison tests with ``||logic:if||`` 

We have already seen similar logic in blocks such as ``||sprites: on overlap||`` where there were statements such as: **if** a type player overlaps with type coin then destroy coin and increase score.

``||logic:if||`` statements allow us to a programs behavior based on the state of the game.

## Concept: **if** Statement

``||logic:if||`` statements perform a test, and if the logic test evaluates to true, then it will run code that is given. Some further examples are:

* if the score is greater than 10, then give additional countdown time
* if the player has 0 lives left, then game over

These are what are known as comparisons because they compare the value of two things.


To use an ``||logic:if||`` statement block we must fill it with a comparison test. If the test is true the code in the block will run. Below is a comparison to see if high score is greater than 5.

```block
if (info.highScore() > 5) {
    game.splash("Good luck!")
}
```

## Concept: Comparison Operators

TODO - these are the comparison operators write something for the basics >, <, ==


### Example #1: less than 

## Todo for all examples can use items like lives, score, sprite position, sprite velocity

## Task 1a: less than 

## Task 1b: less than 

### Example #2: greater than

## Task #2: greater than

### Example #3: equal 

## Task 3: equal 

### Example #4: using multiple if comparisons 

## Task 3a: equal and greater than test

### TODO 3a simple code that has two different `if` statements + Add a challenge with 4 statements- can check for lives, score, sprite position x, sprite position y
