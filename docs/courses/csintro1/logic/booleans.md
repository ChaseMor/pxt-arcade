# Activity: Boolean Statements

TODO: Play music with conditionals and update life and/or score, button event, direction facing up
Possible targets

In these activities students will work with: 
* ``||sprites:is facing||``
* ``||sprites:showing animation||``
* ``||sprites:overlaps with||``
* ``||controller:is button pressed||``
* ``||controller:was button pressed||``
* ``||scene:tile color colliding with||``
* ``||logic:and||``
* ``||logic:or||``
* ``||logic:not||``

# TODO: Create overview Video covering (list items above mostly).  Provide high level script outline.


## Concept: Sprite Boolean Functions (Methods)

## Vocabulary: Boolean Method 
TODO
# TODO: Create Video covering (list items above mostly).  Provide high level script outline.

Start with the following Turtle commands:  
* Forward *(steps)*  
* Turn *(degrees)*  
* Pen Down and Pen Up  
* Set pen color  
* Set Position *(x,y)*  

## Example: [Simple example 1]
1. Review the code below
2. Create the sample code and run the code
3. Save the code for the task (name it [simple name 1]) 
4. [specific comment - "look for..."]

```blocks  
// simple code here
```  

### ~hint
**Teacher Note**
TODO: These notes get removed for students and go to teacher guide so use exact format - think of advice on how the teacher might help un-stick students or reenforce concept.  A question you might pose.  "Ask students: What happens to the old value when we re-assign a new number to the lives? (Answer: it is destroyed and replaced with new assigned value)"  can use markdown lists here.

## Task: add [something] to the code 
1. starting with the [simple example 1] example 
2. add [something simple....]
3. add [something simple....]
4. Challenge: Try adding [something that they have to infer or that might take a little longer than the simple items above]

```blocks
// :solution

/* example of a full solution that the teacher can use
comments are good!
we need the solution / end-solution tags so we can remove this for student version
*/ 
// :end-solution
```

## Concept: [concept 2 -another item form the list]

# TODO: might need a short video here 

[line or two of high level concept]

## Example: simple example 2 

1. Review the code below
2. Create the sample code and run the code
3. Save the code for the task (name it [simple name 1]) 
4. [specific comment - "look for..."]

```blocks  
// simple code here
```  

## Task: add [something] to the code 
1. starting with the [simple example 1] example 
2. add [something simple....]
3. add [something simple....]
4. Challenge: Try adding [something that they have to infer or that might take a little longer than the simple items above]

### ~hint
 // Hint to student
### ~

```blocks

// :solution

/* example of a full solution that the teacher can use - good to follow on previous solution but not required
comments are good!
we need the solution / end-solution tags so we can remove this for student version
*/

// :end-solution
```

## What did we learn? [create 2 questions]

1. Describe how a [concept 1] makes programming easier, more powerful, reduced code, or something.... .  
2. Compare and contrast [something in the real world with coding] grocery store line or ask student to come up with a comparison.  
3. [Come up with a question of your choice]
