# Activity: Final Project

At this point, we have the tools necessary to build a variety of games. In this activity, students will develop their own games from scratch. 

In prior projects, the games being developed were in the form of a minimum viable product; that is, one that is as quickly as possible, to demonstrate the concepts and ideas without too much extra fluff. In this activity, you should aim to build out a full game - either based off of an old MVP game, or from an entirely new concept. This will likely take multiple days to fully develop into a polished final product.

## Student Task: Building a full game

### Requirements:

* Use at least one concept from each section of the course - for example, from `Motion and Events`, you could use ``||controller:control sprite with vx vy||``, ``||sprites:on overlap events||``, and / or sprite physics
* Choose **four** sections from the course, and use at least one additional concept from each
* For each of the above concepts, write a short sentence on how it allows your game to be more interesting or reactive for the player

### Challenge: Learning new blocks

A significant of software development comes down to learning - about new functions and methods available to you, new concepts that allow you to more easily complete your work, and all sorts of other things.

For this challenge, you will dig into one of two groups of functions that we have largely avoided in this course: ``||music:Music||`` and ``||animation:Animation||`` (animation is found as an extension). To complete this challenge, you should use one of these two groups sections in your example game in a thoughtful way; this means that you will have to read through the functions **on your own**, and identify both how it works, and what it can be used for.
