**Possible Answers:**

These are sample answers - student answers will vary widely based on individual taste and the game they build.

1. Tiles Background are not transparent to the Tile map background.  Learned Have to match the color of back ground for areas wanting to appear transparent or design tile to use the entire 16x16 pixels.
2. Having a projectile come from a sprite when a particular tile is hit by the player sprite was my favorite feature of the game.  Used the hit tile event to launch the projectile.
