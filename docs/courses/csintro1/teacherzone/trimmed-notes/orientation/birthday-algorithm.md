# Activity: Birthday Algorithm
This Activity requires Pencil and Paper (no need for a computer).

In this lesson students follow a series of steps to complete a math trick. Students are introduced to
* Algorithms
* Program flow
* Debugging

## Algorithm

An Algorithm is series of steps, decisions and/or formulas. Some common examples include:

* cooking recipes
* map directions to an address
* assembly instructions

## Birthday Algorithm

## What did we learn? 

1. Describe how well the Algorithm worked. Explain what made the algorithm work or what was tried when it did not work.
2. Explain how the Algorithm could be improved in terms of efficiency and usability for the participant. Be sure to describe how to reduce the number of steps while maintaining the trick.
3. Extra: Write full equation at each step. Then try to simplify each answer. Example: first 4 steps

    1. `m`  &nbsp; *(`m` = month)*
    2. `7m`
    3. `7m - 1`  
    4. `(7m - 1)13 = 91m - 13` 

## Rubrics

### ~hint

Start on the left rubric column (5pts), if the work meets the rubric measurement continue to the right (7pts, 9pts, 10pts). Award the score of the right most rubric that is passed. This means that to get the highest score student must pass all previous rubrics.
