## Concept: Arrays from functions

## Example #2a: Using ``||sprites:array of sprites of kind||``

## Example #2b: Fireworks

## What did we learn?

1. How could using arrays of sprites influence the way you design games? List at least **two** ways.
2. How is using ``||sprites:array of sprites of kind||`` easier than keeping track of all the sprites in an array manually?

### ~hint

Sample Solutions:

1. Easier to keep track of multiple sprites, easier to pick random sprites, easier to use sprites in loops. 
2. You do not have to add in a new sprite every time a sprite is added, or remove a sprite every time one is destroyed.
