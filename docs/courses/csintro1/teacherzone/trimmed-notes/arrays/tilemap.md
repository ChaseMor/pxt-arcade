## What did we learn?

1. How do the tile map blocks introduced in this lesson make it easier to set up a level?
2. In this lesson, were there any times in which a level accidentally became too hard or impossible to complete? Explain how this might happen when adding randomness to levels.

### ~hint

Possible Solutions:

1. The blocks allow for you to place sprites within different tiles on the screen more easily, and add random behavior ot the tile map
2. Answers will very, but likely due to blocking exits with walls or enemies.
