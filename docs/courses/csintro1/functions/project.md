From what we learned in the previous lessons we should be able to make some great games. 

## Student Task #1:

1. Generate several quick game ideas (at least 3) and discuss with another student on what is good and what can be improved
2. Pick the game to be built and design a simplest version of that game to start with. We call this a MVP or Minimum Viable Product.  It is the simplest version of a a product that has some working features
3. Make the MVP fast - not perfect.  Test it and show it to others for feedback.  Decide which features you will add to the game
4. Use at least 2 functions
5. Use at least **10** of the following in creating a game:
  * Sprites
  * Projectiles
  * ``||loops:update||`` every loop
  * Position (set or change coordinates)
  * Controller (dx) and ``||controller:control sprite with||``
  * Overlap Events / sprite kind
  * Random
  * Showing numbers as string
  * Score / life
  * Countdown
  * Flip
  * Stay in screen / ghost
  * Set image
  * Sprite say
  * Splash
  * create / on create
  * Math (multiply, divide, add, or subtract)
  * set background color
6. Challenges - Use the following in creating a game:
  * A function that sets up a sprite
  * A function called from more than one place
  * An extension
  * Use at least 3 functions
7. Repeat this process as time allows, until you've created as many games as required for the project

## What did we learn? 

1. What did you learn making a MVP version of the game?  What was useful and what was difficult?
2. Were items in the list of elements of a game to use in the game were not used?  Why? If all were used explain which ones were essential to the game versus less essential elements of a game.
