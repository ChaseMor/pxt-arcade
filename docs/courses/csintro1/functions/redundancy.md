# Activity: Reduce redundancy using functions

Besides simplifying long sections of code, functions are also regularly used to reduce redundancy in code, similar to loops. Using functions, we can take code that is repeated in multiple locations, and keep it in one centralized location. That way, when there are changes needed or bugs found, the code can be updated in a single place, instead of multip

In this activity, students will be introduced to:
